            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm space-y-2">
                <li>Avoid prolonged sun exposure.</li>
                <li>Avoid deodorant for underarm waxing.</li>
                <li>Avoid cosmetics & perfumes for facial waxing.</li>
                <li>Avoid chemical peels for one week after wax.</li>
                <li>Avoid exercise as sweating and oils can clog pores and disrupt the healing process.</li>
                <li>Take only lukewarm showers as heat can cause more irritation to the already sensitive skin.</li>
                <li>For any bikini/brazilian waxing it is recommended to also avoid intercourse.</li>

                <p><strong>TIMING! TIMING! TIMING!</strong><br>Because of the essential timing in getting the hair to grow back at the same rate, if you wax too early, the hair will grow back too early...</p>

                <p><strong>DO NOT SHAVE BETWEEN WAXES</strong><br>One, this completely defeats the purpose of waxing, and two, you’re allowing your hair the chance to all grow at the same rate...</p>
